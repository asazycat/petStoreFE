Welcome to PetStore Webapp!

I am using the public api provided by https://www.petfinder.com/developers/ to build a web application showing pets to adopt and the organisations to get them from. This is very early stage at the moment.

I am making this project to better practice my taiwlind css, react hooks, react user experience features (lazy loading, react suspense .etc) and  modern react tools/packages.

project setup:

fork -> git clone -> npm i -> npm run dev

Pets returns a list of pets and each pet selected opens that one.
